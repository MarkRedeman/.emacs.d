#+TITLE: README, Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Andrea Turso

* 1. What is this?

  This is my personal collection of customisations to GNU/Emacs.

* 1-1. Dependencies

  The project is subdivided in different files and directories in a
  structure similar to that of the Prelude package.

  The ~init.el~ startup script is evaluated immediately after opening
  Emacs, this file loads ~load-path.el~ and then bootstraps the editor
  by pulling in all the individual modules declared in the ~modules/~
  directory.

  Below is a list of some of the packages required to run this this
  particular configuration of Emacs.

  - [[http://ecb.sourceforge.net/][ecb]]
  - [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]]
  - [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][projectile]]
  - [[http://company-mode.github.io/][company-mode]]

  - [[https://github.com/ejmr/php-mode][php-mode]]
  - [[http://web-mode.org/][web-mode]]
  - [[https://github.com/defunkt/coffee-mode][coffee-mode]]
  - [[https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet][yasnippet]]
  - [[https://github.com/magit/magit][magit]]
  - [[https://github.com/pidu/git-timemachine][git-timemachine]]

  Because all those packages are imported at once in startup stage, a
  fresh Emacs instance can take up to 8 seconds before it's ready.

  While I understand it would be desirable to use the autoloading
  mechanism to defer loading the components until they are eventually
  needed, I do not plan on focusing on this in the immediate future.

  Eventually I'll find the time to introduce *el-get* to ensure
  the latest version of all third-party libraries is always present
  in the elisp folder.
